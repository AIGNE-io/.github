## ✨ Welcome to AIGNE ✨

**Your TypeScript-first foundation for building, managing, and observing powerful, real-world AI Agents.**

AIGNE is a comprehensive ecosystem to empower developers to create intelligent 🧠, robust 💪, and scalable 📈 AI applications. Our **AIGNE Framework** serves as the core, providing the building blocks for sophisticated AI agents. Complementing the framework are essential tools and features designed to streamline your development workflow 🚀 and provide deep insights into your agents' behavior 👀.

The AIGNE ecosystem comprises:

* **AIGNE Framework:** The composable, TypeScript-first framework for constructing the logic and capabilities of your AI agents.
* **AIGNE Studio:** A user-friendly interface (potentially a web application or IDE extension) for visually designing, testing, and managing your AI agents. 🎨
* **AIGNE CLI:** A powerful command-line interface for scaffolding projects, automating tasks, and interacting with your AIGNE applications. 💻
* **AIGNE Observability:** Tools and features integrated into AIGNE for monitoring, tracing, and debugging your AI agents in development and production. 🔬

This interconnected approach ensures a seamless and efficient experience throughout the entire lifecycle of your AI agent applications. ✨
